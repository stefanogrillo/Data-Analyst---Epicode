# Data Studio

In this projec, we connected Google Analytics 4 [Google Merchandize Store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWtUf0mKhk) to Google Data Studio to create a [report](https://datastudio.google.com/s/vJEumyFDKzk). The objective is to understand the functioning of such a tool.

So, Nelly and me created a first report about This Year's New Users. We created a Table with the labels: Day and New Users, that then we used to derive a Time Series graph (and a trendline). The process is really fast and smooth compared to programming. We included two Control Labels: to control the Days, and the Countries. <br>
Moreover we added three Schedas for Points: Conversion, and two created metrics: New Users (over Total Users), and Conversions (over Total Users).

The second page of the report focuses on Visualizations, New Users, and Total Users per Country. We added a Table with the four labels already mentioned, and three selectors (Control Labels): Days, Countries, Cities. Moreover, we added two graphs: a Map to depict the Visualizations per country, and a Bar Plot to depict Visualizations, New Users and Tot Users per Country.

Then we decided to dive into the Sessions by Device, so to see what our users use to access the webpage.

The last step we took was to summarize everythin in a special "Dashboard", which has been our playground for this first-time-ever in Data Studio. <br>
Here we collected some Control Labels: New Users, New Users (over Total Users), Conversions, Conversions (over Tot Users), Visualizations, and Tot Gains. <br>
Then two selectors. We then started to analyze data from basic steps:
1. where does Traffic come from? (Most is Organic or not identified)
2. when is Traffic coming? And how much Transactions does it generate per Weekday? (Most Traffic comes on Tuesdays, and most Transactions too)
3. how many New Users this Year? (Descending Trend Line)
4. from which Countries does Traffic come from? (Most Traffic comes from US)
5. from which Devices does Traffic come from? (Most Traffic comes from Desktop)
