# Data Studio

In this projec, we connected Google Analytics 4 [Google Merchandize Store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWtUf0mKhk) to Google Data Studio to create a [report](https://datastudio.google.com/s/vJEumyFDKzk). The objective is to understand the functioning of such a tool.

So, Nelly and me created a first report about This Year's New Users. We created a Table with the labels: Day and New Users, that then we used to derive a Time Series graph (and a trendline). The process is really fast and smooth compared to programming. We included two Control Labels: to control the Days, and the Countries. <br>
Moreover we added three Schedas for Points: Conversion, and two created metrics: New Users (over Total Users), and COnversions (over Total Users).
